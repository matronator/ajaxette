# Ajaxette

Very simple lightweight AJAX implementation for [Nette](https://nette.org)

## Install

With npm:

```
npm install ajaxette
```

## Usage

Just call `registerAjaxHandlers` anywhere after the page is loaded and that's it! Everything else must be handled server-side by Nette and proper use of `{snippet}` tags.
